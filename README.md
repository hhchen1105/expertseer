ExpertSeers
===========
ExpertSeers is a generic framework for expert recommendation based on a digital
library.  Given a query term *q*, ExpertSeers recommends experts of *q* by
retrieving authors who published relevant papers of a certain quality.
ExpertSeers is domain independent. It can be applied to different disciplines
and applications because it is automated and not tailored to a specific
discipline. 

We apply the framework to build CSSeers, an expert recommender systems based on
the CiteSeerX digital library and recommends experts in computer science.  Visit
http://csseers.ist.psu.edu/ to see the demonstration.
